# Mobile Vision API Demo
Google Developers Festival Hanoi 2016 is held in Posts and Telecommunications Institude of Technology at November 26th, 2016.

I have a talk about Mobile Vision API in Android (Vietnamese), with comparison against OpenCV. This repository contains demo code from multiple examples of Google about Mobile Vision API, including face detection, a funny overlay graphic within detected face, barcode detection, text recognition and usage of multi-detectors. 

Note that those examples are from Google, I just make some modifications for easier reading and organizing. I myself implement a simple face detection using OpenCV on Android for reference. Slide will be public after the conference ends.
